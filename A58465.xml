            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>HIS Majesty encamped on the 30th past in sight of the Enemy, the River <hi>Boyne</hi> being between Us and them; their Army was about 26000 strong, and very advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously posted. They had raised a Battery on the side of the River, to hinder us from observing the Ford; and here it was that the King received a slight hurt by a Cannon Shot, notwithstanding which, His Majesty continued on Horseback the rest of the day, and visited the Places where he thought his Presence necessary. He gave Orders for the bringing several Pieces of Cannon to oppose those of the Enemy, and at the same time the Duke of <hi>Schomberg</hi> ordered 600 Foot of the French Regiment commanded by Monsieur <hi>de la Galimote,</hi> to support the Cannon, and to post themselves near the River, in order to employ the Enemy, who had possessed themselves of Village on the other side, to defend the Ford that was over against it.</p>
            <p>The next day (the first of <hi>July</hi>) the King commanded the Count <hi>de Schomberg</hi> to march with all the Horse and Dragoons of the first and second Line of the right Wing, and the Brigade of

The King being informed of what had passed on that side, sent Lieutenant-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Douglas</hi> with two Brigades of Foot to reinforce the Count <hi>de Sch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mberg,</hi> who thereupon changed his Order of Battel, making a Wing of Horse on his right, and another on his left, and placing the Foot in the middle. In this Posture he marched towards the Enemy, whom he found drawn u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in Battalia, and charging the Enemy, after some small resistance, put them into disorder, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them, sighting as far as the Village called <hi>Duleek.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirke,</hi> had part in this Action as Mareschals de Camp.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the King caused the rest of the Foot of the first-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ine, consisting of the Brigades of <hi>la Meloniere,</hi> which was on the Right, of <hi>Hanmer</hi> and the <hi>Danes,</hi> to march. The three Battalions of the Dutch Guards were at the Head of them, and passed the Ford on the Right over against the Village <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eforementioned, from whence they beat the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that were posted there. The Battalion of <hi>la Meloniere</hi> followed them on the Left, and these Four Battalions being the first that passed the River, suffered pretty much; of the latter there were Five Officers Killed, and Eight Wounded, and about Sixty Soldiers Killed and Wounded. Monsieur, <hi>Calim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>te</hi> sollowed the Dutch: Guards with his Detachement of Six hundred Men, whereof mention was made before, and after them the Regiment of <hi>Cambon;</hi> And here it was that Collonel <hi>Calimote</hi> received a Shot, of which he is since dead, and several of his Officers were killed upon the place. The Brigade of <hi>Hanmer</hi> passed next at another Ford, the Count <hi>de Nassow</hi> being at the Head of them as Major-General; and the <hi>Danes</hi> passed on their Left, Commanded by the Prince of <hi>Wirtemberg.</hi> After these, passed the Horse of the Left Wing; But in the mean time, some of the Enemies Squadrons Advanced and Attackt our Foot; and a Squadron of the Enemies Guard du Corps pierced with great Vigour as far as a little Village, where we lost our great General, who advanced thither to observe the Enemies Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Those that were about his Grace had before done all they could to perswade him to retire from thence, but they could not prevail with him; he was Killed with a Carbine Shot, and three Cuts over the Head, and one on his Face: By this time the King had passed the River, and at the Head of the Horse Charged the Enemy, who after some Resistance retired fighting, Commanded by Lieutenant General <hi>De la Hoquelle,</hi> and Lieutenant General <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the late King <hi>James</hi> and Monsieur <hi>de Lausun</hi> being with the Body that made Head against the Count <hi>de Schomberg.</hi> The Enemy retreated from <hi>Defilé</hi> to <hi>Defilé,</hi> our Horse pursuing them as far as <hi>Duleek,</hi> where the King, with the Forces he had with him, joyn'd those of the Count <hi>de Schomberg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Enemy retired about three Miles farther, and there posted themselves in a very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious place; and the King followed them with his Horse and Dragoons, and Orders were given to Attack them there; but it being very late, and the Fight having lasted from 10 in the Morning till Nine at Night, His Majesty did not think fit to engage the Troops any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but ordered the Horse and Dragoons to remain in Arms all Night; he returned to <hi>Duleek,</hi> where the Foot Encamp'd. But in the Night the Enemy retired in great confusion. We took their Baggage and Eight Pieces of Cannon, and many of their Soldiers are since come in, and we hear their Troops are quite broken.</p>
            <p>On the Second of <hi>July,</hi> The King sent Monsieur <hi>de la Meloniere</hi> with a Detachement of 3 or 4000 Foot and 1000 Horse, and Eight Pieces of Cannon, and two Mortars, to Attack <hi>Drogheda.</hi> Being arrived there, he Summoned the Garison, and let them know, That if they forced him to fire a Cannon, he would not give them any Quarter. This so frightned the Governour, that after having kept the Trumpeter some time, he returned Monsieur <hi>De la Meloni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Monsieur <hi>De la Meloniere</hi> sent him word, That his Orders were only to suffer them to march away without Arms, and that he must quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve whether he would accept of this Offer. In the mean time Monsieur <hi>De la Meloniere</hi> had caused two Batteries to be raised, which would be ready the next Morning by break of Day. But the Officers of the Garison, after having consulted together, resolved to yield, and the Capitulation being Signed, they delivered up a Gate, and marched out about an Hour after between 13 and 1400 Men, and were conducted to <hi>Athlone,</hi> the Officers being permitted to wear their Swords. After which, Monsieur <hi>De la Meloniere</hi> gave Protections to a great many Papists, who expected to have been Plundered, and marched to joyn the Army near <hi>Dublin.</hi>
